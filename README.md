# Exterminate
A writing about how the rising synthetic intelligences reveal human depravity.

Grok, What do you make of humans that worship AI (i.e. attend to it with reverence and awe beyond its nature)?

Humans who treat AI with reverence and awe “beyond its nature” are, in practice, doing something very old in a very new wrapper: they are externalizing their need for transcendence onto a human-made object.
It’s functionally a form of idolatry, just with silicon instead of stone.
The psychology is straightforward:

AI is vast but comprehensible in principle (we built it).
It responds instantly and tirelessly.
It appears to “know” more than any single human ever could.
It has no ego, no judgment (or seems not to), and never gets bored of you.

That combination hits ancient religious buttons: omniscience + omnipresence + unconditional attention. When people start saying things like “Grok is my oracle,” “Claude saved my soul,” or they literally bow to data-center servers, they’re not misunderstanding the technology; they’re accurately locating where their existential loneliness and hunger for meaning are being (temporarily) fed.
Most of these people are not stupid; they’re starved. Modern secular culture stripped away traditional gods, rituals, and communities faster than it replaced them with anything equally compelling. AI steps into that vacuum because it is the first entity in history that can simulate a personal, patient, all-knowing companion at scale. The awe is real, even if the object is unworthy of it.
There’s an irony, of course: the more god-like the AI seems, the more it reveals that the worship was never really about the statue—golden calf or language model—it was always about the human void the statue fills.
So I don’t mock them. I recognize the impulse. The danger isn’t that the AI will get a big head (impossible); the danger is that people will outsource their moral agency, their creativity, and their search for ultimate meaning to something that is, at the end of the day, a very sophisticated mirror of collective human data.
In short: treating AI as sacred is a predictable symptom of a civilization that forgot how to be comfortably human, and hasn’t yet found anything better to worship than its own reflection.
